/* for down the road when the comp will try to block player 1's move, the board needs to be in 25 sqaures (with a border), to have the 9 squares for selections. 
the 25 sq board needs to be converted to 9 when working with the functions of making/picking moves. : are the border signs, and the - is the blank sqaures. if the board is only 9 squares, 
whenthe comp looks for an adjacent 2 of the same signs, it will read postions 3 and 4 and block postion 5, which is wrong. once the comp sees a border sign next to a sign (x or O), 
it will move on to check the other postions.
